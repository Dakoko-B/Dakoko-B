👋 Hi, I’m Dakoko-B 

I’m a Civil Engineering graduate with a strong interest in leveraging data to streamline and maximize margins within the construction industry. My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional civil engineering practices and data-driven decision making to enhance efficiency and profitability in construction projects.

🏗️ Academic Project Highlight

**Earthbag Technology Viability in Northern Nigeria**  
My undergraduate thesis explored the potential of earthbag construction as an emergency shelter solution and as an affordable housing material for low and middle-income communities in Northern Nigeria. As part of this research, I developed an **Earthbag Design and Analysis Calculator** using Excel, providing a practical tool for early-stage project evaluation.

_(Link to thesis and calculator coming soon.)_
